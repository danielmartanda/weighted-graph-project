Assignment 1: Weighted Graph - Shortest Path
Date: October 2025

Project Description: 
This program implements a weighted directed graph using an adjacency list.
It populates graph data from a JSON file and finds the shortest path between 
two nodes using a shortest path algorithm.

Program/Driver Code (Main)
-----------------------------------------
- Prompts user to input a source and target location
- Calculates and prints the shortest path & total cost
- Make sure you print out the location along the path to the destination (if any exist)  
- Includes validation to ensure source and target nodes exist
