Assignment 1: Weighted Graph - Shortest Path
Date: October 2025

Project Description: 
This program implements a weighted directed graph using an adjacency list.
It populates graph data from a JSON file and finds the shortest path between 
two nodes using a shortest path algorithm.

JSON Parsing Method
-----------------------------------------
- Helper method to ingest the provided JSON file to populate the graph
- Each node's adjacency list is constructed from the parsed data. 
- (Optional) Data can be hardcoded if JSON parsing is hard. Resulting in 15% deduction.
- Recommended: Include a print helper method to display all nodes for testing.
