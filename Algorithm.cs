Assignment 1: Weighted Graph - Shortest Path
Date: October 2025

Project Description: 
This program implements a weighted directed graph using an adjacency list.
It populates graph data from a JSON file and finds the shortest path between 
two nodes using a shortest path algorithm.

Shortest Path Algorithm
-----------------------------------------
- Method to compute the shortest path between any two locations (nodes) on the map (graph)
- We can use any algorithm that will find the shortest path between two nodes on a graph
- Add nodes/edges as needed to test out edge cases
- Justify our choice of algorithm in the testing document
