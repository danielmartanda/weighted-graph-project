Project Description: 
This program implements a weighted directed graph using an adjacency list.
It populates graph data from a JSON file and finds the shortest path between 
two nodes using a shortest path algorithm.

//NOTES
/* Dijkstra's algorithm initializes all vertices' distances to infinity (âˆž), initializes all vertices' predecessors
to null, and enqueues all vertices into a queue of unvisited vertices. The algorithm then assigns the
start vertex's distance with 0. While the queue is not empty, the algorithm dequeues the vertex with
the shortest distance. For each adjacent vertex, the algorithm computes the distance of the path from
the start vertex to the current vertex and continuing on to the adjacent vertex. If that path's distance is
shorter than the adjacent vertex's current distance, a shorter path has been found. The adjacent
vertex's current distance is updated to the distance of the newly found shorter path's distance, and
vertex's predecessor pointer is pointed to the current vertex. */

/* 
-----------------------------------------
 Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
 - We used this algorithm because all edge weights (travel times) are non-negative, 
   and it guarantees the optimal shortest path from a source to a destination. 
-----------------------------------------
- Calculates the shortest path between any two locations (nodes) on the map (graph)
- Works with the Graph class (directed and weighted adjacency list)
- Utilizes a queue-based approach to determine the shortest path
- Tracks distances using a Dictionary<string, int>
- Tracks previous nodes to construct a path
- Throws exceptions if invalid source and target nodes are provided
- (Note) May add nodes/edges as needed to test out edge cases
- (Note) Must justify our choice of algorithm in the testing document
